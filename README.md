DocMatic
========

AMOS 2014 Project repository

DocMatic is a web service for managing documents within project groups. It is initially seen as a tool for researchers to manage literature, similar to Zotero or Mendeley, but with superior automation, a robust conception of project groups, and support for users to add additional descriptive information in the form of annotations, tags and labels. Our final concept extends the document management capabilities beyond the niche of academic literature, which means the design should distinguish between functionality specific to academic literature and that which applies to all documents.
